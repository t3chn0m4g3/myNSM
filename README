The script and configuration files are provided only for a fresh install of ubuntu server 14.04, x64 edition. Under no circumstances execute the script in production environment. I am not responsible or liable for any damages this script may cause.

The script will install suricata, elastic, logstash and kibana and enable you within a short amount of time to get your own network security monitoring up and running.

1. Execute the script and answer the questions asked.
2. Grab some coffee, tea or any beverage you like.
3. Enjoy the power of Suricata & ELK.

The install script provides you with a basic configuration where RFC1918 networks are defined as your HOME_NET (see /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml). Further documentation is available at http://goo.gl/3BJXI7.
Oinkmaster will pull rules from Emerging Threats, since they are updated daily and easily accessible (see /etc/oinkmaster.conf). Further documentation is available at http://goo.gl/3BJXI7.

For more information and advanced configuration of your setup please visit the websites of suricata and elk projects.
